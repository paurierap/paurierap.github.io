title: End of GSoC 2021
---

Google Summer of Code 2021 has finally come to an end. During the last 10 weeks I had the opportunity to contribute to an open source project, being an experience 
from which I learnt a lot and, more importantly, an experience that I really enjoyed. This does not mean, though, that my involvement with GridapMakie.jl ends. I will 
continue contributing from time to time to improve and make the package as outstanding as it can be! If given the chance, I would be more than delighted to join GSoC 
2022.

Finally, I want to appreciate the work and effort of all my mentors: Alberto, Eric and Francesc, as well as their patience along the journey. Also, NumFocus is the 
organization that made it possible, so thanks to them, too!
