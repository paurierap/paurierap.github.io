title: GSoC 2021 Project with Gridap
---

On May 17th I received the thrilling news that I would be a part of the [2021 Google Summer of Code program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). From June 7th, I will be coding with [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap) under the NumFOCUS organization. [Alberto F. Martin](https://github.com/amartinhuertas), [Eric Neiva](https://github.com/ericneiva) and [Francesc Verdugo](https://github.com/fverdugo) from Gridap will provide mentorship throughout the whole summer. After an early meeting today, we got to know each other better and we are all ready to hit it! 

Regarding the project itself, we will extend the plotting capabilities of the package [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) to Gridap. More information on the project is available [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/6231266174697472).

Finally, I will try to keep the posts updated with the latest implementations so that you won't miss a thing!
